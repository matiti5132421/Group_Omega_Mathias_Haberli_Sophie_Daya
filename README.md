# Predicting the Difficulty of French Text Using AI

**Group OMEGA: Mathias HÃ¤berli, Sophie Daya**

## Project Description
This project aims to predict the difficulty level of French sentences using various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and CamemBERT. Throughout this README and the accompanying GitHub repository, we will explore which model is the most capable of classifying French texts according to their difficulty level. Additionally, after demonstrating and training the best model, we will apply it in a real-world scenario: an application.

We are proud to present the first application from our startup, "LogoRank." We hope this README will not only convince you of our approach but also provide you with valuable insights into text classification. Join us on this exciting journey as we push the boundaries of natural language processing and machine learning!

## Introduction
In this project, we aim to develop and compare several machine learning models to predict the difficulty level of French sentences. The difficulty levels are categorized into six classes: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2, corresponding to different proficiency levels as per the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).
